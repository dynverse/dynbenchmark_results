# Manuscript

The manuscript is not yet published, but once it is you will find a link here!

For now, here are some cats with wisdom:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
devtools::install_cran("cowsay", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
library(cowsay)
cat(say("All benchmarks are wrong, but some are useful!", type = "string"))
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cat(say("There are two types of scientists: those who discover, and those that organise what is already there.", type = "string", by = "longcat"))
```
