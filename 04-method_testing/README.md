# Quick testing of methods using small datasets

As finding one dataset on which all methods are able to execute
successfully, each method also has its own *specific example* dataset.
At the very least, each method should be able to execute on their own
specific example.

<img src = ".figures/method_testing_figure.png" width = "350" height = "980" />
